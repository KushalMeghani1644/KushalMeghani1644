## 🧰 Rusty-Suite

I’m currently building and maintaining the **Rusty-Suite** — a collection of FOSS Rust projects, focused on both practical tools and low-level system utilities:

WEBSITE:
- rusty-suite.tech

PRODUCTS:

- [`RustyTodos`](https://github.com/KushalMeghani1644/RustyTodos) — A simple and powerful TUI-based todo app (also being ported to Tauri GUI)
- [`RustyBoot`](https://github.com/KushalMeghani1644/RustyBoot) — A custom Rust-based bootloader
- [`ls-rs`](https://github.com/KushalMeghani1644/ls-rs) — A clean `ls` clone in Rust
- [`Rusty-Checker`](https://github.com/KushalMeghani1644/Rusty-Checker) — A RowHammer vulnerability testing tool

> _All of them are **built with ❤️ in Rust**._
