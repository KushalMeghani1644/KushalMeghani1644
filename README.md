# Greetings, traveler

Out of all the corners of the internet, you’ve found your way to my GitHub profile. Whether by chance or intention, I hope your visit is worth your while.

I am **Kushal Meghani**, a Rust enthusiast, systems programmer, and explorer of low-level development. I spend my days building safe, high-performance tools and contributing to open-source projects. My current focus is on OS development, memory management, and hardware security.

Feel free to browse my projects—you might discover something useful, inspiring, or just interesting to look at. Some of my work includes:

- **[Rusty-Suite](https://rusty-suite.tech)** – A curated collection of Rust tools, ranging from productivity apps to system utilities and security research tools.  
- **[Oxide](https://github.com/KushalMeghani1644/Oxide)** – A programming language I’m bootstrapping, situated between Rust and C.  
- **[RustyTodos](https://github.com/KushalMeghani1644/RustyTodos)** – A TUI-based todo app evolving into a full desktop application using Tauri.  
- **[RustyBoot](https://github.com/KushalMeghani1644/RustyBoot)** – An experimental UEFI bootloader written entirely in Rust.  
- **[ls-rs](https://github.com/KushalMeghani1644/ls-rs)** – A memory-safe reimplementation of the classic `ls` command.  
- **[Rusty-Checker](https://github.com/KushalMeghani1644/Rusty-Checker)** – A tool to detect RowHammer vulnerabilities in DRAM.

If you’d like to know more about me, my **[personal website](https://rusty-suite.tech)** has details about my work, projects, and interests.  

I’m always open to collaboration—whether it’s building something new, exploring Rust systems programming, or tackling security challenges. If you’re interested in working together, don’t hesitate to reach out via **[email](mailto:kushalmeghani108@gmail.com)** or check my repositories for ideas.

Thank you for stopping by. May your visit here be insightful and inspiring.
